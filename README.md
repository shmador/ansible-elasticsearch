# elasticsearch

A combined **Terraform** and **Ansible** solution to provision and configure an Elasticsearch & Kibana cluster on AWS EC2.

## Overview

This project automates the deployment of a multi‑node Elasticsearch and Kibana cluster on Amazon AWS.  
- **Terraform** scripts launch EC2 instances, set up networking (VPC, security groups for Elasticsearch and Kibana ports), and generate an SSH key pair.  
- The custom **Ansible** roles (`elasticsearch/` and `kibana/`) then install and configure Elasticsearch and Kibana on those instances, forming a fully operational cluster and front‑end.  

This separation—Terraform for infrastructure and Ansible for software configuration—makes the setup reproducible and easy to maintain.

## Main Features

- **Custom Ansible Roles**  
  - `elasticsearch/` role installs and configures Elasticsearch on each node.  
  - `kibana/` role installs and configures Kibana on each node, ensuring it connects back to the local Elasticsearch cluster.  
- **OS Support**  
  - Works on both Debian‑family (e.g. Ubuntu) and RedHat‑family (e.g. CentOS/RHEL) distributions.  
  - Each role detects the OS and uses the appropriate package manager (APT or YUM) and service manager (systemd).  
- **Version Selection**  
  - Specify Elasticsearch and Kibana versions via Ansible defaults (e.g. `es_version` and `kibana_version`).  
- **Optional Security**  
  - Enable optional X‑Pack security features (TLS, authentication) for Elasticsearch and Kibana via Ansible variables.  
- **Terraform Provisioning**  
  - Creates AWS resources: EC2 instances (one per cluster node by default), security groups (opening ports 9200/9300 for ES, 5601 for Kibana), and an SSH key pair.  
  - The private key is saved locally; the public key is registered with AWS.  
- **Terraform & Ansible Integration**  
  - Terraform outputs generate an Ansible inventory (`inventory/hosts.ini`) listing the new EC2 instances.  
  - `ansible.cfg` is pre‑configured to use this inventory and the generated SSH key.  
- **Automation Script**  
  - `run.sh` ties everything together for CI‑style automation: Terraform then Ansible (both Elasticsearch and Kibana roles) in one command.

## Requirements

- **AWS Account:** Permissions to create EC2 instances, security groups, and key pairs.  
- **Terraform (v0.12+):** Installed and in your `PATH`.  
- **Ansible (v2.9+):** Installed to run playbooks and roles.  
- **AWS Credentials:** Export via environment variables or configure via AWS CLI.  
- **SSH Key:** Automatically generated by Terraform (private key stored in project root, referenced by `ansible.cfg`).

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Terraform Provisioning

1. **Initialize Terraform:** In the project root (where `main.tf` resides), run:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
2. **Apply Terraform:** Create the AWS resources:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
   Confirm when prompted (or add `-auto-approve` to skip prompts). Terraform will then launch the EC2 instances, create the security group, and generate an SSH key pair.
3. **SSH Key Output:** After apply, Terraform saves the private SSH key (e.g. `ansible-elasticsearch.pem`) in the project directory. The `ansible.cfg` file is pre-configured to use this key for SSH connections. 

### 2. Running the Ansible Playbook

After Terraform finishes, configure the software stack with Ansible:

1. **Check Inventory:** Terraform populates `inventory/hosts.ini` with the new instance IPs under a group (e.g. `[elasticsearch_nodes]`). This inventory file and SSH key are already referenced by `ansible.cfg`.
2. **Run Ansible:** Execute the main playbook to install Elasticsearch on all nodes:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory/aws_ec2.yml main.yml
   ```
   Ansible will SSH into each EC2 instance, install the specified version of Elasticsearch, configure the cluster, and start the service.

### 3. Full Automation (`run.sh`)

For convenience, the `run.sh` script automates both Terraform and Ansible steps:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

This script will (in order) initialize and apply the Terraform configuration, then run the Ansible playbook using the generated inventory and key. It’s ideal for CI/CD pipelines or demo setups, allowing a complete deployment with a single command.

---

You will now have a running Elasticsearch cluster on AWS. You can connect to any node (its public DNS/IP) on port 9200 to interact with the cluster’s REST API. Adjust any cluster-specific settings (such as index or security configurations) via Ansible variables or additional playbooks as needed.
